# Hack Technology / Project Attempted


## What you built? 

So here I followed a Flutter tutorial to build a Windows Desktop app.
I've always been interested in building desktop apps, so I gavce Flutter a whirl. I initially wanted to try somethin like a RESTful app and doing something with genomics/cell data, and while I was able to find data I wasn't really able to find any API's (the *cell* consistently gave me Excel results), or maybe I didn't look in the right places. I think that's something I'd give a whirl to later.

Include some screenshots.

## Who Did What?

Worked by myself.

## What you learned

I had a lot of trouble setting up Android tools, good lesson in realizing if somethin says its obsolete, it probably is LOL.

Helped me also learn more about git, Github as well as GraphQL

Kind of reminds me of npm a bit with the, or the `flutter do this` and `flutter do that`
